        <p>Me chamo Inara e esse é o trecho de uma das minhas músicas favoritas:</p>
        <h3>I went too far - Aurora.</h3>
        <p>I went too far when I was begging on my knees<br>
         Begging for your arms, for you to hold them around me<br>
        I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet<br>
        Waiting for your love, waiting for our eyes to meetbr<br>
        <br>
        Crying, give me some love, give me some love and hold me<br>
        Give me some love and hold me tight<br>
        Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me<br>
        Give me some love and hold me tight<br>
        <br>
        I went too far when I was begging on my knees<br>
        When I cut my hands so you could stand and watch me bleed<br>
        I went too far and kissed the ground beneath your feet<br>
        Standing in my blood, it was a taste of bittersweet<br>
        <br>
        Crying, give me some love, give me some love and hold me<br>
        Give me some love and hold me tight<br>
        Oh, give me some love, give me some love and hold me<br>
        Give me some love and hold me tight<br>
        <br>
        Why can't I turn around and walk away?<br>
        Go back in time?<br>
        I had to turn around and walk away<br>
        I couldn't stay, I had to walk away</p>
    </body>
